## To Skin Server Owner  
CustomSkinLoader is designed for loading from any server, which makes it complex.  
It's not a good idea to refer to CustomSkinLoader's source code to develop your own skin mod.  
It's recommended to use CustomSkinLoader for your server directly.  
Furthermore, you can add your server to 'Default Load List'.  
You also can use 'ExtraList' which makes it easier for user to adds your server into load list.
